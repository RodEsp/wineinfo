Taut fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide the backbone while orange peel marks the finish. Drink 2019–2025.",,90,57.0,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe,Sangiovese,Podere Scopetone
217,Quinta de Foz de Arouce 2013 Red,Portugal,"Wood aging gives this ripe blend of Baga and Touriga Nacional its richness and density. It's full of black fruit, toast and a touch of pepper. With ripe tannins and crisp acidity, it can easily age another year. Drink from 2018.",,90,20.0,Beira Atlantico,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Portuguese Red,Quinta de Foz de Arouce
218,Robert Mondavi 2015 Fumé Blanc,US,"Pithy, with grapefruit and lemon peel flavors, this wine is deceptively crisp and light on the nose, offering a wealth of body and lushness on the palate, accented with nutmeg and peach. It includes 4% Sémillon, partly from the winery's beloved To Kalon vineyard.",,90,20.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Fumé Blanc,Robert Mondavi
219,Samuel Tinon 2015 Megyer Dry Furmint,Hungary,"From a vineyard in Northern Tokaj this dry Furmint has aromas of citrus pith and freshly cut pineapple. In the mouth, there are delightful flavors of grapefruit juice and white peach before the pleasantly acidic finish.",Megyer Dry,90,36.0,Tokaj,,,Jeff Jenssen,@worldwineguys,Furmint,Samuel Tinon
220,Sixteen by Twenty 2014 Chardonnay,US,"Briny green olive notes underlie a tropically ripe, full-bodied expression of the variety. The wine's apple, pineapple and mango fruit is wrapped in toasted oak and moderate acidity.",,90,40.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Chardonnay,Sixteen by Twenty
221,St. Pauls 2014 Passion Riserva Pinot Bianco,Italy,"This opens with enticing aromas of chamomile flower, white peach and a whiff of Alpine herb. The elegant palate offers McIntosh apple, candied lemon and a vein of energizing mineral. Fresh acidity lends balance.",Passion Riserva,90,40.0,Northeastern Italy,Alto Adige,,Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe,Pinot Bianco,St. Pauls
222,Talenti 2011 Trentennale,Italy,"Chopped herb, forest floor, leather, espresso and a balsamic note are some of the aromas that waft out of the glass. The powerfully structured palate delivers prune, dried cherry, tobacco, and roasted coffee bean framed in firm fine-grained tannins. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink to capture the fruit richness. Drink 2018–2023.",Trentennale,90,,Tuscany,Brunello di Montalcino,,Kerin O’Keefe,@kerinokeefe,Sangiovese,Talenti

224,Mendel 2014 Lunta Malbec,Argentina,"Blackberry and road-tar aromas are dark and stout. This is moderately tannic and a bit rough and jagged on the palate. Flavors of stewed black plum and prune are ripe almost to an extreme, and that's how it finishes as well.",Lunta,90,22.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Malbec,Mendel
225,Oldenburg 2013 Chardonnay,South Africa,"There's a pleasant, toasty seam throughout the nose and mouth of this well-balanced wine, expressed in notes of sweet spice and honeycomb that frame the yellow melon and apple fruit core. It's plush and mouthfilling, but not flabby or overdone, thanks to balancing acidity and an assertive spicy tone that dominates the finish. Drink now.",,90,25.0,Stellenbosch,,,Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz,Chardonnay,Oldenburg
226,Oldenburg 2014 Chenin Blanc,South Africa,"This is a round and rich wine, with notes of wood-grilled apple, guava and toasted challah. Smooth and lush in feel, ripe peach and tropical tones drive the palate, while hints of honeysuckle and baking spice unfold on the finish. Ample acidity keeps the wine's weight in check. Drink now.",,90,20.0,Stellenbosch,,,Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz,Chenin Blanc,Oldenburg
227,Wagner 2006 Grace House Pinot Noir,US,"The deep ruby color belies this wines cool-climate origins. The nose shows more black fruit aromas than is typical for Pinot Noir. The palate is all Pinot, though, with cherry pie filling flavors made more complex by vanilla from toasty new oak. It finishes with some nice mineral and earth notes. Silky tannins allow for immediate consumption but the wine will gain in complexity after a year or two in the cellar.",Grace House,85,15.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,,,Pinot Noir,Wagner
228,Treleaven 2006 Semi-Dry Riesling,US,"A thoroughly honest effort, opening with lovely quince, apple and lemon fruit. The palate has a crisp lime edge and finishes with a kick of refreshing acidity. Drink now.",Semi-Dry,85,14.0,New York,Cayuga Lake,Finger Lakes,,,Riesling,Treleaven
229,Benessere 2005 Costa Del Sol Red,US,"Not clear what the varietal blend is, but it's like a nice, easy southern Rhône wine. Soft and fruity, it's rich in jammy blackberry, cherry, Mandarin orange, chocolate and anise spice flavors.",Costa Del Sol,85,18.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,Red Blend,Benessere
230,Bloomer Creek 2006 Gewürztraminer,US,"Orange blossom and flowers lead on this Gewürtz, and on the palate, a citric, lemon edge outweighs the sweet and floral components that would give this wine a prettier edge. Nonetheless, the wine has an attractive, crisp and clean character and will pair well with grilled seafood and poultry.",,85,16.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Susan Kostrzewa,@suskostrzewa,Gewürztraminer,Bloomer Creek
231,Andean Sky 2007 Bonarda,Argentina,"Meaty and rubbery, but that's young Bonarda. This is a sound wine with dark berry flavors, raisin and pulsing acidity. Still, there's modest roundness to the palate and length to the finish. Overall, it's tasty, full and borderline raisiny. Drink now.",,85,10.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Bonarda,Andean Sky
232,Angove's 2006 Red Belly Black Shiraz,Australia,Lifted cedar and pine notes interspersed with appealing woodsy scents give way to a surprisingly intense palate that shows some nice peppery notes but ultimately falls short on the finish. Nearly imperceptible tannins suggest early consumption.,Red Belly Black,85,12.0,South Australia,South Australia,,,,Shiraz,Angove's
233,Silvan Ridge 2006 Reserve Pinot Noir,US,"There is an odd, piercing edge to the aromas, a mix of acetic acid and pungent herb, with a hint of diesel. Somehow it's not off-putting, just atypical. The light, tart fruit is a mix of rhubarb and cranberry, very earthy and tasting of dirt and bark in the finish. This could be quite pleasant with a hearty, rustic dish such as beef Bourgogne.",Reserve,85,28.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Pinot Noir,Silvan Ridge
234,Talamonti 2007 Cerasuolo Rosè,Italy,"Neutral and unassuming on first impact, this luminous rosé eventually delivers notes of mineral, ash, stone fruit and small berry. The wine offers more in the mouth, however, where it exhibits fresh flavors of raspberry and blueberry.",Cerasuolo Rosè,85,10.0,Central Italy,Montepulciano d'Abruzzo,,,,Montepulciano,Talamonti
235,Testarossa 2006 Thompson Vineyard Syrah,US,"Overly sweet and simple, and something of a disappointment given the winery's past performance, this Syrah tastes like melted cherry jam, stirred with chocolate pie filling and sprinkled with fennel and pepper.",Thompson Vineyard,85,49.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,,,Syrah,Testarossa
236,Meeker 2004 Kiss Ridge Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"Shows rich, firm mountain tannins and well-ripened, concentrated flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and cocoa, and is thoroughly dry. But the wine loses a few points for hot caramelization, which may be partly over-charred oak and partly shriveled, overripe berries, if not both.",Kiss Ridge Vineyard,85,85.0,California,Diamond Mountain District,Napa,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Meeker
237,Consorzio Vini Tipici di San Marino NV Moscato,Italy,"The wine boasts a beautiful appearance thanks to its saturated golden color and faint amber highlights.

238,D'Arenberg 2006 The Derelict Vineyard Grenache,Australia,"The sort of wine one imagines early Australian settlers gulped down—big and burly in the mouth and a bit warm, rough and dusty on the finish. Hints of mint-accented cherry fruit and earthy notes.",The Derelict Vineyard,85,29.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Grenache,D'Arenberg
239,Dogwood 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon,US,"A little rough and rugged, with jangly tannins and blackberry fruit so ripe it veers into raisins. Very dry, it's probably at its best now.",,85,36.0,California,Mendocino,,,,Cabernet Sauvignon,Dogwood
240,Domaine du Tariquet 2007 Ugni Blanc-Colombard,France,"Dominated by Ugni Blanc, the grape also used in the local Armagnac brandy, this is a tight, crisp wine, green but not unpleasantly so. Its acidity comes from fresh apple flavors, touched with some good juiciness and a fine refreshing finish. Screwcap.",,85,9.0,Southwest France,Vin de Pays des Côtes de Gascogne,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Ugni Blanc-Colombard,Domaine du Tariquet
241,Falcor 2005 Sangiovese,US,"Sweetly rich in cherry, red currant and chocolate flavors, with a peppery edge, this Sangiovese is soft in structure. The bright acidity can cut through tomato sauce with cheese.",,85,34.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,Sangiovese,Falcor
242,Hayman & Hill 2007 Reserve Selection Chardonnay,US,"Made in the modern California style, with very ripe, rather sweet pineapple jam, green apple butter and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture.",Reserve Selection,85,15.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,,,Chardonnay,Hayman & Hill
243,Hermann J. Wiemer 2002 Blanc de Blanc Chardonnay,US,"This sparkling wine starts with a toasty but soft nose, leading into clean but fruity flavors and a refreshing finish.

Wiemer
244,J. & F. Lurton 2007 Herederos de François Lurton Villafrance de Duero Red,Spain,"Simple but well-maded wine with aromas of chewing gum, cherry and blackberry. It's a plump, sort of grabby red with sweet raspberry and chocolate flavors followed by a creamy, soft finish. Not much complexity but good fruit and depth. Not the least bit hard to drink. Good mass wine.",Herederos de François Lurton Villafrance de Duero,85,13.0,Northern Spain,Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y León,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Red Blend,J. & F. Lurton
245,Finca Las Moras 2007 Reserve Chardonnay,Argentina,"Not exactly a world-class white wine but at least it smells and tastes like Chardonnay. The nose offers some butter and lemon curd, while the palate is jumpy and tastes like a mix of pear, apple and spice. A fresh, young wine that should be drunk soon.",Reserve,85,12.0,Other,San Juan,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Chardonnay,Finca Las Moras
246,Long Flat 2006 Destinations Sauvignon Blanc,Australia,"Juicy and well balanced, this is an admirable effort at the price. Boxwood, grapefruit, lemon and quince notes make for a sophisticated first impression. The palate is straightforward citrus while gooseberry notes pop up on the dry finish. Drink now.",Destinations,85,15.0,South Australia,Adelaide Hills,,,,Sauvignon Blanc,Long Flat
247,Work 2004 Reserve Merlot,US,"Tasty, with pie-filling cherries, blackberries and currants accented with smoky oak, but a little on the soft side. Fully developed, so drink now.",Reserve,85,25.0,California,Sonoma Mountain,Sonoma,,,Merlot,Work

249,Autumn Hill 2007 Petit Verdot-Merlot Red,US,"Cherry pie-filling and boysenberry notes open this impressive blend of Merlot and Petit Verdot. Abundant but velvety tannins give a lift to blueberry and   chocolate tones in the mouth, while the slightly grippy finish shows appealing mixed berry flavors.",Petit Verdot-Merlot,85,18.0,Virginia,Monticello,,,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Autumn Hill

251,Cherry Hill 2006 Papillon Estate Pinot Noir,US,"Spicy and tannic, this inexpensive Pinot from Cherry Hill opens with earthy fruit and leaf flavors—tomato and herb dominate, with just a suggestion of berry. There isn't much in the way of ripeness here, to either fruit or tannins.",Papillon Estate,85,22.0,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Pinot Noir,Cherry Hill
252,Cloud 9 2006 Seity Zinfandel,US,"Shows the briary, brambly character of Foothills Zin, with an array of wild berry, tobacco, mocha and Asian spice flavors wrapped into finely ground tannins. But the wine is too sweet and candied in the finish. Drink now.",Seity,85,35.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,,,Zinfandel,Cloud 9
253,Cueva de las Manos 2007 Reserve Malbec,Argentina,"Huge in color and extract, but also a little childish. The nose has gumball, berry jam and a touch of volatility, but after things settle it rests on bold black fruit. It's not overly rich or sweet, and the feel is sort of sinewy. Seems more about size and color than refinement and polish.",Reserve,85,15.0,Mendoza Province,Luján de Cuyo,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Malbec,Cueva de las Manos
254,David Fulton 2008 Petite Sirah,US,"The winery has a good track record with this bottling, which shows how well Petite Sirah does in the warmer St. Helena appellation of Napa Valley. This '08 is dryish to moderately sweet in jammy blackberries and blueberries, with a smoked meat, bacon edge. But it's also firmly tannic, which provides a framework for the sweetness.",,89,45.0,California,St. Helena,Napa,,,Petite Sirah,David Fulton

256,Goats do Roam Wine Co. 2008 Goat-Roti Syrah-Viognier,South Africa,"A good value, this is an easy-pleasing Syrah with vibrant notes of red plum, cherry and blueberry.

257,Graham Beck 2007 The William Red,South Africa,"This approachable Cabernet-based blend, which also has 18% Pinotage, 11% Cab Franc and 2% Shiraz, is a spicy and balanced red with notes of menthol, purple florals, black cherry and berry. With a mouthfeel like crushed velvet, a black pepper finish and an attractive price tag, it's a shame only 100 cases were produced.",The William,89,18.0,Coastal Region,,,Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz,Red Blend,Graham Beck
258,Hartenberg 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon,South Africa,"This wine strikes a superb balance between herbaceous, green notes and ripe black fruit, all graced with a kiss of sweet vanilla.

259,Vignobles 46N118 2007 Noir 46 Malbec,France,"Tannic yet balanced wine with a great swathe of perfumed fruit as well as dense black flavors.

260,Willamette Valley Vineyards 2009 Estate Pinot Noir,US,"Young, tart and wrapped up tight as a drum, this offers sharp flavors of cranberry and a bit of Campari.

261,Algodon 2008 Estate Blend Gran Reserva Red,Argentina,"A blend of 50% Malbec with Cabernet, Syrah and Merlot that's lightly minty and full of tobacco, pepper and spicy aromas.

262,Beaver Creek 2008 Fairytale Red,US,"Beaver Creek makes a variation of Fairytale every vintage and this one, sourced from Napa Valley, is 41% Merlot, 36% Zinfandel and 23% Syrah, a mix that seems to work very nicely here.

263,Byron 2009 Monument Pinot Noir,US,"A very good Pinot Noir, rich in cherry, licorice, cola and spice flavors that are wrapped into firm tannins.

264,Jardin 2007 Syrah,South Africa,"A good amount of earthy spice, tea leaves and forrest floor lead the way on the nose, but the black cherry and berry fruit aromas follow shortly after with an additional accent of sweet cured meat.

Words like opulent and elegant come to mind to describe intense flavors of black cherries, licorice, cola, herb tea and Indian spices.

290,Château Lafon-Rochet 2011  Saint-Estèphe,France,"This is a wine that has great potential—you can tell from the firm tannins, tight acidity and closed texture.

293,Kilikanoon 2009 Green's Vineyard Shiraz,Australia,"This wine displays ample concentration in its inky color and potent aromas of dark berry fruit. There's a hint of raisining as well. In the mouth, it's mouthfilling but lacks a bit of texture; the flavors include dark plums, vanilla and hints of dried fruits, like figs and dates.

318,Aresti 2007 Reserva Merlot,Chile,"Fiery and wild at first, with aromas of cinnamon, pepper and Juicy Fruit gum.

336,Koyle 2015 Costa Pinot Noir,Chile,"Gritty, heavily roasted aromas of peanuts and herbal berry fruits lead to a scratchy, tannic palate.

523,Ruby 2015 Steve's Reserve Pinot Noir,US,"There's a whiff of volatility upon opening, then a rush of bright, tangy orange and cherry fruit. The 20% new oak aging does not really come through in scent or flavor. Though not in any way effervescent, this young release carries an impression of carbonation in the finish.

930,Bodega Calle 2014 Alberti 154 Malbec,Argentina,"Roasted, woodsy, rubbery aromas are gamy and staunch, with berry notes interspersed. Grabby, rubbery tannins make for a rugged palate, while roasted plum and gamy flavors are a touch salty.

932,Château les Petits Arnauds 2014 Tradition,France,"The wood flavors are still prominent in this spicy wine. Heavily influenced by rich Merlot, the wine is lightly structured and more about juicy red fruits.

936,Chehalem 2013 Ian's Reserve Chardonnay,US,"This is surprisingly light, having dropped significantly in alcohol from the previous vintage. Green-fruit flavors touch on banana and apple, and the wood—31% new and 26% once-used—seems to show a bit of rawness.

943,Finca del Marquesado 2013 Crianza,Spain,"Slightly gritty aromas are just barely ripe enough. This feels tight, acidic and like tomato juice.

966,Kono 2008 Sauvignon Blanc,New Zealand,"The 2004 and 2005 vintages of this wine were priced at $15, which gives some idea how fast the supply of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc has increased.
